% Multi Robot Localization, Reconstruction and Exploration~\cite{xiangyu2021coxgraph}~(\textbf{First Author, IROS 2021 Best Paper Award Finalist on Safety, Security, and Rescue Robotics in memory of Motohiro Kisoi}).
% \SubBulletItem
% Brief:
% We are exploring and pushing the limit of multi robot dense reconstruction and navigation system with higher performance on mapping and functionality of complicated exploration and searching task.
% By integrating recent multi robot localization and optimization methods, and bringing in a new map compression algorithm, my paper proposes a new system able to build dense map with global consistency, robustness and work under less than 100 KB/s of bandwidth.

% Project 1:
% AESV: Autonomous Environmental Service Vehicle
% \SubBulletItem
% Brief:
% Cooperating with major network providers, tourist sights and multiply client companies, we are building the next-generation vehicle teleoperation platform.
% With our partners providing island-wide 5G network and vehicles, our platform is able to teleoperate vehicles across the island, with low-latency image and 3D map transmission, even real-time force feedback.
% We are exploring different application scenarios and vehicles for our teleoperation technology, and standardize our platform and its installation process on vehicle.
% \SubBulletItem 
% Project 2:
% Distributed LiDAR: low-cost full-angle obstacle detection sensor module.
% \SubBulletItem
% Brief:
% The most common way to achieve full-angle obstacle detection is to mount lidar or several depth cameras, which turn to be less cost-effective and require high computation resources.
% This project is aimed at development of new sensor modules catering users' demand of cheap, light-weight and flexible solution to obstacle detection.
% Several modules are already ready-to-ship.
% One module with flexible design can adhere to desired surfaces.
% One module with optical fibre conducting light, of which 32 fibres can be embedded in UAV propeller protectors.
% This project has international patents in several countries.
